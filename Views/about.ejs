              Welcome to our indie game library 🍓<br><br>
              A cozy little space where creativity meets code. This website was made to collect and share unique games made by small teams, solo devs, and passionate weirdos like us.<br><br>
              Every game here has its own soul, story, and aesthetic. Whether you're into pixel art, narrative adventures, or soft nostalgia vibes, there's definitely something for you.

            <p class="TextColor_Dark3 AboutText">
              All the games on this site are part of a growing digital collection.<br><br>
              You can explore by genre, rating, or just let luck choose with the random game button 🎲<br><br>
              Each title comes with a short desc and cute cover art so it's easy to find hidden gems. This is a chill space where players and creators can vibe together.

              Hi! I’m <strong>Abcia2</strong> 🫶🏻<br><br>
              A solo dev who loves storytelling, animation, and those dreamy liminal spaces where reality blurs with imagination.<br><br>
              I’m the creator behind games like <em>Gacha Story</em> and <em>Hoops Runs</em>, with a focus on emotional journeys, aesthetic freedom, and characters that stick with you.<br><br>
              When I’m not coding, I’m probably editing videos or turning little thoughts into little games 🎮💫

              This space was made to gather all my projects in one cozy digital corner.<br><br>
              But it’s also here for anyone who wants to explore something cute, nostalgic, or just a little different.<br><br>
              It’ll keep growing, just like the games inside it ✨
